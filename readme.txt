The simplest way to insert `rel=nofollow` links into your posts or pages.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to insert links with the nofollow rel tag to prevent search engines from crawling them. The shortcode also supports `target=` and `title=` attributes. 

== Installation ==

1. Download the latest zip file and extract the 'nofollow-shortcode' directory.
2. Upload it to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
3. Activate 'Nofollow Shortcode' on the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Insert `[nofollow url="link-url.com"]Example link[/nofollow]` in your post or page (replacing your link's information).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the shortcode? =

Simply type `[nofollow url="link-url.com"]Example link[/nofollow]` into your post. Replace `link-url.com` and `Example link` with your link's information.

You can also include other link optional attributes (if they are omitted, the title attribute will not be inserted and the target will default to _blank). A full example of the shortcode's potential is `[nofollow url="link-url.com" title="Title of Link" target="_top"]Link Text[/nofollow]`.

You can also use the shorter shortcodes of `[nofol]` and `[nofo]` in the same way as `[nofollow]`.

As of version 1.1, you may use the `href=` attribute instead of `url=` as that was causing a bit of confusion. However, both tags are still acceptable.
